## Project Overview
Determining fair and accurate employee salaries is a complex task influenced by multiple factors like education, experience, occupation, and work hours.\
This project aims to develop a machine learning model using Gradient Boosting to predict employee salaries based on relevant features.\
We also examine accuracy of different ML algorithms and move forward by training the model with high accuracy. 

## Problem Statement & Proposed Solution
Predicting employee salaries accurately is crucial for fair compensation and data-driven HR decisions.
This project aims to develop a machine learning model using Gradient Boosting to estimate salaries based on demographic and job-related features.

## Tech Stack
â€¢Library required to build the model:
- Pandas : loading, cleaning, and analyzing structured salary data in DataFrames.
- Numpy : numerical operations and efficient array manipulation.
- Scikit learn : data preprocessing, model training (Gradient Boosting), and evaluation.
- Matplotlib : visualize data distributions, outliers, and model performance comparision.
- Gradio : the deployment of an interactive web interface 
- Joblib : Saves and loads the trained machine learning model
  
## Results
The Gradient Boosting model provided high accuracy of 86.18% in predicting salaries using multiple input features.\
Gradio provided a UI for better visiblity and ease of use. 

## Conclusion
Gradient Boosting outperformed simpler models due to its ensemble nature.\
The use of gradient boosting allowed the model to capture non-linear relationships and feature interactions effectively.
